Although environmental and physiological stimuli are clearly responsible for changes in the expression levels of many genes, it is not known whether the majority of changes of gene expression fixed during evolution between species and between various tissues within a species are caused by Darwinian selection or by stochastic processes. We find the following: (1) expression differences between species accumulate approximately linearly with time; (2) gene expression variation among individuals within a species correlates positively with expression divergence between species; (3) rates of expression divergence between species do not differ significantly between intact genes and expressed pseudogenes; (4) expression differences between brain regions within a species have accumulated approximately linearly with time since these regions emerged during evolution. These results suggest that the majority of expression differences observed between species are selectively neutral or nearly neutral and likely to be of little or no functional significance. Therefore, the identification of gene expression differences between species fixed by selection should be based on null hypotheses assuming functional neutrality.

ASIt accounts for minimally different variants within a sample of closely related languages, thus it does not need a thorough part of speech (POS) disambiguation, since the ""trivial"" identification of basic POS (e.g. Nouns vs Verbs) is not enough to capture cross-linguistic differences between closely related languages. Secondly, the linguistic variants cannot be reduced to lexical distinctions only, i.e. syntactic differences are in general unpredictable on the basis of the properties of single lexical items. A specific tag set designed to capture sentence-level phenomena without taking into consideration POS tags is needed. As a consequence, while other tag sets are designed to carry out a gross linguistic analysis of a vast corpus, the ASIt tag set aims to capture fine-grained grammatical differences by comparing various dialectal translations of the same sentence. Moreover, in order to pin down these subtle asymmetries, the linguistic analysis must be carried out manually.

To explain why the needs for ASIt are so special we have to take into consideration two different aspects: the nature of Italian dialects, and the kind of linguistic theory ASIt aims to interact with. The Italian dialectal area presents a kind of variation that involves parametric choices affecting many general aspects of syntax, morphology, and phonology. The kind of information we want to gather involves not only the presence of a certain element, but also the absence of an element; an element can be omitted only in some constructions and in conjunction with specific characteristics of the language. For this reason, ASIt proposed the creation of a specific set of tags starting from a universal core shared by all languages (on the basis of the work done by DynaSAND), and subsequently developing a language-specific periphery which is compatible with other projects.

Dialectal data stored in the ASIt were gathered during a twenty-year-long survey investigating the distribution of several grammatical phenomena across the dialects of Italy. These data and information were collected by means of questionnaires formed by sets of Italian sentences: dialectal speakers were asked to translate them into their dialects and write their translations in the questionnaire; therefore, each questionnaire is associated with many parallel dialectal translations.

See: http://challenge.semanticweb.org/

The major part of the dataset was crawled from the Web of Linked Data during March/April 2010 based on datasets provided by Falcon-S, Sindice, Swoogle, SWSE, and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework. We also included partial data from data.gov and data.gov.uk. 

The downloaded content was parsed using the Redland toolkit with the rdfxml parser. We rewrote blank node identifiers to include the data source in order to provide unique blank nodes for each data source, and appended the data source to the output file. The data is encoded in NQuads format and split into chunks of 10m statements each.

BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based, highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL).  BAO currently has over 1000 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies.  It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen, Format, Meta Target, Design,  Detection Technology, and Endpoint.  Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen).  Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation).  Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based, organism-based, and variations thereof.  The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal.  Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal.

It covers processes that are linked to the regulation of gene expression as well as physical entities that are involved in these processes (such as genes and transcription factors) in terms of ontology classes and semantic relations between classes. GRO is intended to represent common knowledge about gene regulation in a formal way rather than representing extremely fine-grained classes as can be found in ontologies such as the Gene Ontology (GO) (created for data base annotation purposes) and various relevant databases. The main purpose of the ontology is to support NLP applications. It has a particular focus on the relations between processes and the molecules (participants) involved. The basic structure of the GRO is a direct acyclic graph (DAG) with ontology classes as nodes and is-a relations between classes as edges. The taxonomic backbone is further enriched by several semantic relation types (part-of, from-species, participates-in with the two sub-relations agent-of and patient-of).",http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1106,True,"1,0",-,-,"Name: BioPortal project on behalf of ontology owner., Email:support@bioontology.org",-,-,Web:http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1106 Name:Vivian Lee Email:Absent,-,5210,3100,0.6,-,-,-,-,-,False,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,0.087,8.742,-,[],http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1106/.well-known/void,VoID file offline,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,0.05,0.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.165,8.516739835458685e-07,0.05,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In particular these metrics do not distinguish IAO-developed terms versus terms imported from other ontologies, and do not count existing author or definition annotations

Please note: The ontology metrics displayed by BioPortal are incorrect as of 8/11/2011. If you need accurate number you will need to compute them on your own, until further notice.

It provides a semantic specification of the terms to be used in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics and manages the related knowledge, thus allowing the standardization for immunogenetics data from genome, proteome, genetics, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures.
IMGT-ONTOLOGY manages the knowledge through diverse facets relying on seven axioms, ""IDENTIFICATION"", ""CLASSIFICATION"", ""DESCRIPTION"", ""NUMEROTATION"", ""LOCALIZATION"", ""ORIENTATION"" and ""OBTENTION"". These axioms postulate that any object, any process and any relation can be identified, classified, described, numbered, localized and orientated, and the way it is obtained can be characterized. The axioms constitute the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY, also designated as IMGT-Kaleidoscope. As the same axioms can be used to generate concepts for multi-scale level approaches, the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY represents a paradigm for system biology ontologies, which need to identify, to classify, to describe, to number, to localize and to orientate objects, processes and relations at the molecule, cell, tissue, organ, organism or population levels.

The need for ontologies that provide a systematic arrangement of available data and allow cross talk across various related domains is gaining momentum. In this backdrop, we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy, bio-molecules, chemicals and drugs, pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries.

The five nodes are: classic metabolic pathways, regulatory pathways, signaling pathways, drug pathways and disease pathways for complex human conditions. KEGG and Reactome databases, as well as extensive literature searches have been used to choose terms and their position within the tree. A complex human disease pathway is viewed in the context of genetic and environmental attributes that can affect or impair the functioning of various molecular and cellular pathways; their combined, accumulated effect is manifested in the diseased phenotype. In many cases the identity of the malfunctioning dynamic entity is speculated rather than known. Metabolic, regulatory or signaling pathway terms have associated terms for the altered version of the pathway and the level at which the alteration(s) may occur. Proteins with mutations known to affect a particular pathway can be annotated to the normal and altered version(s) of the pathway and to a disease pathway, if known. The ontology provides a unified way to annotate gene products to any type of pathway as well as to deviant pathways. Its hierarchical structure offers the researcher a 'view' of the connections, if not the dependencies between individual pathways, of the possible link between alterations within these complex biological circuitries and diseases.",http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1035,True,"1,0",-,-,"Name: BioPortal project on behalf of ontology owner., Email:support@bioontology.org",-,-,Web:http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1035 Name:Victoria Petri Email:Absent,-,16830,223,0.01,-,-,-,-,-,False,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,0.075,7.492,-,[],http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1035/.well-known/void,VoID file offline,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,0.05,0.0005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.165,4.6839070290744893e-07,0.05,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

""Michaelis constant""), a precise classification of mathematical expressions that describe the system (eg. ""mass action rate law""), the modeling framework used (eg. ""logical framework""), and a branch each to describe entity (eg. ""macromolecule"") and interaction (eg. ""process"") types, and a branch to define the different types of metadata that may be present within a model.

SBO terms can be used to introduce a layer of semantic information into the standard description of a model, or to annotate the results of biochemical experiments in order to facilitate their efficient reuse. SBO is an Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) candidate ontology, and is free for use. More information about SBO can be found from the project FAQ, at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo/

SNP-Ontology is general enough to enable the representation of variations observed in genome of various species. Latest versions of SNP-Ontology include the representation of haplotype and of CNV. The unambiguous representation of genomic variations provided by SNP-Ontology enables to integrate heterogeneous data related to genomic variations. To achieve this goal SNP-Ontology enables (1) to represent one variation in accordance with various ways that exist for describing it, (2) to represent the equivalence between two distinct descriptions of one variation, and (3) to represent correspondence between a genomic variation and its outcome at the transcriptome and proteome levels.",http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1058,True,"1,0",-,-,"Name: BioPortal project on behalf of ontology owner., Email:support@bioontology.org",-,-,Web:http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1058 Name:Adrien Coulet Email:Absent,-,42131,7090,0.17,-,-,-,-,-,False,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,0.075,7.492,-,[],http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1058/.well-known/void,VoID file offline,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,0.05,0.0085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.165,1.0755074490205456e-06,0.05,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

SO-Pharm enables to represent pharmacogenomic relationships between a drug, a genomic variation and a phenotype trait. In addition, it enables to represent patient and more largely panel included in trials, and populations. SO-Pharm enables the representation of measured items on this patients such as results from the observation of a phenotype trait or of genomic variations. SO-Pharm supports knowledge about pharmacogenomic hypothesis, case study, and investigations in pharmacogenomics.

**The BPR - Bibliografia del Parlamento italiano e degli studi elettorali**  (Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and Electoral Studies) is a database of bibliographic references of books and articles in periodical journals addressing the history of the Italian Parliament and the history of elections. In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:  

* the Italian Parliament, from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848, the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;
* elections (laws, procedures, results), with reference to general elections as from 1848.  

The BPR addresses primarily studies in law, plus studies in political science, organisational science, political sociology, as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  
Each bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes, which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  
The BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers, it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs, judgements, articles from periodicals, contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.

This dataset is an open archive of PHB published after 2009.

The dataset is one result of the french project untitled VESPA (Value and optimization of epidemiosurveillance devices in a sustainable crop protection strategy) leading by INRA.

A PHB is an information document, both technical and regulatory in nature, written under the responsibility of a regional epidemiological surveillance committee. A PHB gathers information about the health status of crops. It first presents pest risk analysis, and it is also used to disseminate regulatory information (mandatory control order, national notes, regulation evolution, etc.) and non-regulatory information (description of pest biology or prophylactic methods, such as management of intercropping, tillage, choice of cultivars, etc.).

To access PHB a french thesaurus has been developed called FrenchCropUsage. This is a thesaurus of types of crops, organized according to their destination (direct human food, animal feed, food industry, etc) and the type of culture system (field crop, market gardening, etc.). This thesaurus represents the French point of view.

> Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) is a freely available dictionary of molecular entities focused on ‘small’ chemical compounds. The term ‘molecular entity’ refers to any constitutionally or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, complex, conformer, etc., identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity. The molecular entities in question are either products of nature or synthetic products used to intervene in the processes of living organisms.

> ChEBI encompasses an ontological classification, whereby the relationships between molecular entities or classes of entities and their parents and/or children are specified.

## Openness
