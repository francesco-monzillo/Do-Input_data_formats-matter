ANNO consists of two components: ANNOdc, a domain-core ontology providing core entities such as basic anatomical categories, and ANNOds, a domain-specific ontology used for annotating structures of the human skeleton. ANNO is integrated into AnthroWorks3D, a photogrammetry pipeline and application for the creation and analysis of 3D-models of human skeletal remains. The integration is based on the three-ontology method with the General Formal Ontology as the top-level ontology, ANNOdc as the task ontology and ANNOds as the domain ontology. Thus, AnthroWorks3D only needs to implement access to the entities (classes and properties) of the task ontology, whereas the entities of the corresponding domain ontology are imported dynamically. ANNO supports the analysis of skeletal and bone finds in forensic and historical anthropology, facilitating the standardization of data annotation and ensuring accurate preservation of information for posterity.",https://annosaxfdm.de/,-,"0,75",-,-,"Name: absent, email: konrad@gmx.at",-,-,Web:https://annosaxfdm.de/ Name:Konrad Höffner Email:konrad.hoeffner@uni-leipzig.de,-,29928.0,514,0.02,-,-,-,-,-,False,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,0.108,10.825,-,[],,VoID file absent,-,-,-,-,-,0.25,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316666666666666,1.1006281147837054e-05,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"['application/n-triples', 'application/n-triples', 'application/n-triples', 'application/n-triples', '', '', '']",True,0,0.0,0.0

Although environmental and physiological stimuli are clearly responsible for changes in the expression levels of many genes, it is not known whether the majority of changes of gene expression fixed during evolution between species and between various tissues within a species are caused by Darwinian selection or by stochastic processes. We find the following: (1) expression differences between species accumulate approximately linearly with time; (2) gene expression variation among individuals within a species correlates positively with expression divergence between species; (3) rates of expression divergence between species do not differ significantly between intact genes and expressed pseudogenes; (4) expression differences between brain regions within a species have accumulated approximately linearly with time since these regions emerged during evolution. These results suggest that the majority of expression differences observed between species are selectively neutral or nearly neutral and likely to be of little or no functional significance. Therefore, the identification of gene expression differences between species fixed by selection should be based on null hypotheses assuming functional neutrality. Furthermore, it may be possible to apply a molecular clock based on expression differences to infer the evolutionary history of tissues.",absent,False,"0,5",-,-,False,-,-,Web:absent Name:Endre Anderssen Email:endre.anderssen@gmail.com,-,3014.0,0,0.00,-,-,-,-,-,False,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,0.06,5.967,-,[],,VoID file absent,-,-,-,-,-,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11,7.509574707752384e-06,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"['meta/rdf-schema', 'api/sparql', 'meta/rdf-schema', 'meta/rdf-schema']",False,0,0.0,0.0

ASIt accounts for minimally different variants within a sample of closely related languages, thus it does not need a thorough part of speech (POS) disambiguation, since the ""trivial"" identification of basic POS (e.g. Nouns vs Verbs) is not enough to capture cross-linguistic differences between closely related languages. Secondly, the linguistic variants cannot be reduced to lexical distinctions only, i.e. syntactic differences are in general unpredictable on the basis of the properties of single lexical items. A specific tag set designed to capture sentence-level phenomena without taking into consideration POS tags is needed. As a consequence, while other tag sets are designed to carry out a gross linguistic analysis of a vast corpus, the ASIt tag set aims to capture fine-grained grammatical differences by comparing various dialectal translations of the same sentence. Moreover, in order to pin down these subtle asymmetries, the linguistic analysis must be carried out manually.

To explain why the needs for ASIt are so special we have to take into consideration two different aspects: the nature of Italian dialects, and the kind of linguistic theory ASIt aims to interact with. The Italian dialectal area presents a kind of variation that involves parametric choices affecting many general aspects of syntax, morphology, and phonology. The kind of information we want to gather involves not only the presence of a certain element, but also the absence of an element; an element can be omitted only in some constructions and in conjunction with specific characteristics of the language. For this reason, ASIt proposed the creation of a specific set of tags starting from a universal core shared by all languages (on the basis of the work done by DynaSAND), and subsequently developing a language-specific periphery which is compatible with other projects.

Dialectal data stored in the ASIt were gathered during a twenty-year-long survey investigating the distribution of several grammatical phenomena across the dialects of Italy. These data and information were collected by means of questionnaires formed by sets of Italian sentences: dialectal speakers were asked to translate them into their dialects and write their translations in the questionnaire; therefore, each questionnaire is associated with many parallel dialectal translations. At present, there are eight different questionnaires written in Italian and almost 500 questionnaires, corresponding to the eight Italian questionnaires, written in more than 240 different dialects, for a total of more than 54,000 sentences and more than 40,000 tags stored in the data resource managed by the ASIt digital library system.",http://purl.org/asit/alld,-,"0,75",-,-,"Name: absent, email: asifanwar0000@gmail.com",-,-,Web:http://purl.org/asit/alld Name:Gianmaria Silvello Email:silvello@dei.unipd.it,-,420000.0,130,0.00,-,-,-,-,-,False,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,0.121,12.075,-,[],,VoID file absent,-,-,-,-,-,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316666666666666,7.511592963249877e-06,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"['', '', '', '']",False,0,0.0,0.0
