MEDLINE stores over 20 million bibliographic information in life science and is suitable for extracting domain specific abbreviations and their long forms appearing in actual literature.","http://allie.dbcls.jp/","False","0,75","['http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#', 'http://purl.org/allie/ontology/201108#']","[]","False","[]","['http://uri.dbcls.rois.ac.jp/']","Web:http://allie.dbcls.jp/ Name:Database Center for Life Science Email:info AT dbcls.rois.ac.jp","False","0.00","['http://purl.org/allie/ontology/201108#']","['http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapFormat', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadStorage', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMap', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMap', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMapFormat', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapValue', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMapATable', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMapColumn', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapColumn', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapFText', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapATable', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-string', 'http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#ActualProductOrServicesInstance', 'http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#ProductOrServiceSomeInstancePlaceholder', 'http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/eclass/5.1.4/#C_AKJ315005-tax', 'http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Manufacturer', 'http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/eclass/5.1.4/#C_AAB316003-tax', 'http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/eclass/5.1.4/#C_AKE112003-tax', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/VSPX#', 'http://purl.org/allie/ontology/201108#LongForm', 'http://purl.org/allie/ontology/201108#ShortForm', 'http://purl.org/allie/ontology/201108#EachPair', 'http://purl.org/allie/ontology/201108#ResearchArea', 'http://purl.org/allie/ontology/201108#PubMedID', 'http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#work', 'http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#voice', 'http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#internet', 'http://purl.org/allie/ontology/201108#PairCluster', 'http://purl.org/allie/ontology/201108#PairList', 'http://purl.org/allie/ontology/201108#CooccurringShortFormList', 'http://purl.org/allie/ontology/201108#PubMedIDList']","6528405","[]","True","213686670","1.0","-","1.0","1.0","True","1.0","0.9999996272336941","0.987783 (out of 1000000 triples considered)","0.9944444444444445 (out of 180 triples considered)","1.0","0.999998","1.0","1.0","1.0","0.565","56.488","0.8738","0.71845","1.0","0.0001774466580817","0.505","0.9999996","0.4","0.9911137222222222","0.4983333333333333","8.993982547229391e-06","0.75","0.5","1.0","0.0","0.6666666666666666","0.2181818181818182","0.5039781463469407","0.2553840031318176","0.623655531582071","0.6666666666666666","1.0","155484","['index/ftp', 'api/sparql', 'gzip:ntriples', 'meta/void']","True","1","0.8738","1","1.0","1","1","0.98","1.0","1","1.0","1","1.0","1","1","1","1","1.0","1","1","0.5","1","0.88","3.86","2025-06-01"]{"URL for download the dataset":{"description":"Checking whether the data is available as a SPARQL endpoint and is available for download as an RDF dump","input":"(working) SPARQL endpoint or Metadata or VoID file","output":"[]: if the sparql endpoint or rdf dump is not online;

In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  \r\nEach bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes, which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  \r\nThe BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop.

In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  \r\nEach bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes, which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  \r\nThe BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop.

In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:  \r\n\r\n* the Italian Parliament, from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848, the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;\r\n* elections (laws, procedures, results), with reference to general elections as from 1848.  \r\n\r\nThe BPR addresses primarily studies in law, plus studies in political science, organisational science, political sociology, as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  \r\nEach bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes, which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  \r\nThe BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers, it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs, judgements, articles from periodicals, contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.","absent","False","0,5","[]","[]","False","[]","[]","Web:absent Name:Library of the Italian Chamber of Deputies Email:bib_segreteria@camera.it","False","0.0","[]","['http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapFormat', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadStorage', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMapFormat', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMap', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapValue', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMapColumn', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapColumn', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMapATable', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapATable', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapFText', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-string', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMap', 'http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Event', 'http://schema.org/Website', 'http://dati.camera.it/ocd/Deputato', 'http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos#ConceptScheme', 'http://dati.camera.it/ocd/file', 'http://dati.camera.it/ocd/sessioneLegislatura', 'http://dati.camera.it/ocd/post', 'http://dati.intra.camera.it/ocd/votazione', 'http://culturalis.org/cult/0.1#Collections', 'http://culturalis.org/cult/0.1#HolderOfArchives', 'http://culturalis.org/eac-cpf#Person', 'http://culturalis.org/eac-cpf#CorporateBody', 'http://culturalis.org/eac-cpf#Name', 'http://lod.xdams.org/ontologies/ods/file']","30427974","[]","True","1314987","1.0","-","0.9999999914880919","1.0","True","1.0","0.9999995545434758","0.7883 (out of 10000 triples considered)","0.9801980198019802 (out of 101 triples considered)","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","0.507","50.732","0.0","0.5","0.5","1.0129170645581755e-05","0.5075","1.0","0.499035368072538","0.8842490099009901","0.11","7.518489241331637e-06","0.5","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.6666666666666666","0.8761904761904762","0.5000290391821297","0.2715833432104569","0.9978825295971911","0.3333333333333333","1.0","0","['', '']","False","1","0.0","1","0.89","1","1","0.82","1.0","1","1.0","1","1.0","1","1","0","1","0.75","0","1","0.0","1","0.5","3.07","2025-07-13"]["bpr","BPR ?

- Linked Open Data della Camera dei deputati**  \r\n**The BPR - Bibliografia del Parlamento italiano e degli studi elettorali**  (Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and Electoral Studies) is a database of bibliographic references of books and articles in periodical journals addressing the history of the Italian Parliament and the history of elections. In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:  \r\n\r\n* the Italian Parliament, from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848, the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;\r\n* elections (laws, procedures, results), with reference to general elections as from 1848.  \r\n\r\nThe BPR addresses primarily studies in law, plus studies in political science, organisational science, political sociology, as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  \r\nEach bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes, which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  \r\nThe BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers, it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs, judgements, articles from periodicals, contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.","absent","False","0,5","[]","[]","False","[]","[]","Web:absent Name:Library of the Italian Chamber of Deputies Email:bib_segreteria@camera.it","False","0.0","[]","['http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapFormat', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadStorage', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMapFormat', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMap', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapValue', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMapColumn', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapColumn', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMapATable', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapATable', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapFText', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-string', 'http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#array-of-QuadMap', 'http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Event', 'http://schema.org/Website', 'http://dati.camera.it/ocd/Deputato', 'http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos#ConceptScheme', 'http://dati.camera.it/ocd/file', 'http://dati.camera.it/ocd/sessioneLegislatura', 'http://dati.camera.it/ocd/post', 'http://dati.intra.camera.it/ocd/votazione', 'http://culturalis.org/cult/0.1#Collections', 'http://culturalis.org/cult/0.1#HolderOfArchives', 'http://culturalis.org/eac-cpf#Person', 'http://culturalis.org/eac-cpf#CorporateBody', 'http://culturalis.org/eac-cpf#Name', 'http://lod.xdams.org/ontologies/ods/file']","30576153","[]","True","1315351","1.0","-","0.9999999915289691","1.0","True","1.0","0.9999995566827184","0.7883 (out of 10000 triples considered)","0.9801980198019802 (out of 101 triples considered)","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","0.507","50.732","0.0","0.5","0.5","1.0080526720566538e-05","0.5075","1.0","0.4990353680807134","0.8842490099009901","0.11","7.518489241331637e-06","0.5","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.6666666666666666","0.8761904761904762","0.5000289003941399","0.2715842946308565","0.9978920349130864","0.3333333333333333","1.0","0","['', '']","False","1","0.0","1","0.78","0","1","0.63","1.0","1","1.0","1","1.0","1","1","0","1","0.75","0","1","0.0","1","0.5","2.88","2025-09-07"]{"F1-M Unique and persistent ID":{"description":"Unique and persistent identifiers","input":"Metadata","output":"1: dataset registered in a search engine that provides a persistent DOI; 0: otherwise"}}{"Sources":{"description":"stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources","input":"Metadata","output":"string: the website, the name and the email of the source; False: if the sources are not indicated."}}{"SPARQL endpoint URL":{"description":"Checking whether the data is available as a SPARQL endpoint and is available for download as an RDF dump","input":"(working) SPARQL endpoint","output":"url: if sparql endpoint url exists; -: if the sparql endpoint url does not exist"}}{"I3-D Degree of connection":{"description":"Degree of connection","input":"Data","output":"1: contains link to another dataset; 0: otherwise"}}{"Vocabularies":{"description":"checking whether a list of vocabularies used in the dataset is provided","input":"(working) SPARQL endpoint","output":"[]: if the vocabularies used are not indicated; -: the SPARQL endpoint is missing; list of vocabularies: if the vocabularies used are indicated."}}{"F4-M Metadata registered in a searchable engine":{"description":"Metadata registered in a searchable engine","input":"Metadata","output":"1: dataset registered in any search engine; 0: otherwise"}}{"Languages (query)":{"description":"Checking whether data is available in different languages","input":"(working) SPARQL endpoint","output":"False: if no lang tag is retrieved; list of langs: if at least a lang tag is retrieved; -: if the SPARQL endpoint is missing."}}{"Author (query)":{"description":"stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources","input":"(working) SPARQL endpoint","output":"[]: if the author is not indicated; -: the SPARQL endpoint is missing; list of authors: if the author is indicated."}}["LemmaBank","LiLa Lemma Bank","-","https://lila-erc.eu/sparql/lila_knowledge_base/sparql","1","-","['https://github.com/CIRCSE/LiLa_Lemma-Bank']","-","-","-","-","absent","-","-","1","-","-","-","-","-","-","http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa","-","-","-","-","1699687","-","-","-","-","-","21","0,010","0,008","-","0,004698682282560934","The Lemma Bank is a collection of approximately 200,000 canonical forms for Latin that is used to interlink the linguistic resources in the LiLa Knowledge Base.
