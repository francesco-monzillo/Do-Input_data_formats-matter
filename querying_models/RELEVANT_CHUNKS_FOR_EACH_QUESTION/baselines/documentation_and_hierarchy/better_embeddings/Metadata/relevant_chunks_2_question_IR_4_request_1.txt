# WordNet 2.0 (W3C) (2025-05-04)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the WordNet 2.0 (W3C) knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-05-04.   Overall Summary   WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is a medium-sized RDF dataset (about 710,000 triples) with good metadata and strong FAIR sub-scores, especially Reusability (1.0) and solid Findability/Accessibility/Interoperability signals. It provides a machine-readable Apache 2.0 license and indicates accepted RDF media types. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint severely limits verifiability of many metrics and prevents measurement of operational qualities (performance, security) and in-data checks (consistency, accuracy). Although an RDF dump is marked as available in metadata, no download URL was discovered. Overall, the dataset attains a low normalized quality score of 13.3 out of 100\.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Overall Summary   WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is a relatively small dataset (710,000 triples) that shows strong Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability (FAIR) sub-scores thanks to clear metadata, a machine-readable license (Apache 2.0), registration in search engines, and use of standard RDF/OWL formats. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint severely limits measurable quality: many dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.) score zero because they cannot be assessed. While an RDF dump is indicated as online and common media types are listed, no actual download URLs were discovered in the metadata. Overall, the dataset has a low normalized quality score of 12.1 out of 100\.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Overall Summary   WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is a modest-sized dataset (about 710 thousand triples) with a strong FAIR profile thanks to an accessible RDF dump, standard RDF media types, and a machine-readable Apache 2.0 license. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint prevents measurement of many important dimensions (Performance, Security, Intrinsic, and most Representational metrics), and depresses the overall normalized quality score to 12.1 out of 100\. Interlinking metadata indicates connections to 12 other datasets, but interlinking completeness is 0.0 and no SKOS mappings could be verified. Verifiability is moderate due to the presence of sources and some author metadata, believability is high, and reputation (PageRank) is low.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Overall Summary   WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is a medium-sized dataset (about 710,000 triples) that benefits from clear metadata, an explicit machine-readable license (Apache 2.0), and good FAIR scores for Accessibility, Interoperability, and especially Reusability. However, like many static RDF dumps without an online SPARQL endpoint, its operational quality is limited across several dimensions. The lack of a working SPARQL endpoint prevents checks for security, performance, consistency, accuracy, and many representational metrics, and also yields a zero Interlinking score despite being connected to 12 datasets at the metadata level.

Overall Summary   WordNet 2.0 (W3C) is a medium-sized knowledge graph (about 0.71 million triples) with good FAIR characteristics driven by an online RDF dump, standard/open formats, and a clear machine-readable license. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint prevents assessment across many important dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.) and drags down the overall quality. The normalized quality score is 12.08 out of 100 (overall score 0.121). Interlinking signals exist in the metadata (degree of connection 12), but without a queryable endpoint, deeper link quality cannot be verified.

Overall Summary LiLa Lemma Bank is a modestly sized linked data resource (about 1.70 million triples) underpinning the LiLa Knowledge Base’s interlinking of Latin lexical resources. It achieves strong FAIR sub-scores for Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability thanks to rich metadata, a machine-readable license, and publisher/source details. However, the SPARQL endpoint appears missing or offline, so most query-based checks could not be performed. This results in zero scores across many critical dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.) and a low normalized quality score of 12.1 out of 100\. An RDF dump is indicated as available via GitHub, but no commonly accepted RDF media type is detected in the metadata, limiting reuse.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

This single improvement would enable measurement (and likely improvement) across Performance, Security, Representational, Intrinsic, and Dynamicity dimensions.   - Publish an RDF dump in a commonly accepted RDF serialization (e.g., Turtle, N-Triples, RDF/XML) and declare its media type in metadata to improve Interoperability/Versatility and the FAIR I1-D subprinciple.   - Expose human-readable licensing information alongside the machine-readable license.   - Provide language tags, vocabulary usage, labels/comments counts, and examples in metadata or via SPARQL to boost Understandability.   - Add update frequency and last-modified dates to improve Currency/Timeliness.  ---  ##   ##   ##   ##   ##   ##   ##   ##   ##   ##   ## Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science (2025-07-13)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-07-13. Overall Summary Allie is a large life-sciences KG with an operational SPARQL endpoint and multiple RDF media types, leading to very strong FAIR scores (3.88/4) and high marks for Accessibility, Security, Accuracy, and Conciseness. Licensing and publisher information are clearly provided and machine-readable. Performance is acceptable (median latency \~539 ms, 2 req/s). Weak points include extremely low interlinking (Degree=1, near-zero centrality), modest understandability, and consistency issues flagged by an ontology hijacking problem. Despite a “Monthly” update frequency in metadata, the creation date is old (2011-08-01) and no modification date is retrievable.

Overall Summary   LiLa Lemma Bank contains about 1.7 million triples and achieves relatively strong FAIR sub-scores for Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability, with moderate Interoperability (F=0.82, A=0.75, I=0.50, R=0.75; total FAIR=2.82). A machine-readable CC BY-SA license and source/publisher information are provided in metadata, and a download location is listed. However, the assessment treats the SPARQL endpoint as missing/offline, which prevents measurement of many critical dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.) and yields zero scores across them. Interlinking metrics are present in metadata, but the Interlinking score remains 0\. Overall normalized quality score: 12.1 out of 100\.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Overall Summary   Allie is a large life-science terminology dataset (94.4 million triples) with a clear machine-readable license and some helpful documentation elements (e.g., examples). However, the absence of a working access point (SPARQL endpoint offline/missing and no RDF dump available) critically impairs accessibility, performance, security, and most intrinsic checks. Interlinking is minimal, and many representational and dynamicity metrics cannot be assessed. The resulting normalized quality score is 9.992 out of 100, driven mainly by license/publisher metadata, dataset size, and FAIR metadata presence, but held back by lack of operational access and limited interlinking and interoperability.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Overall Summary   Allie is a very large knowledge graph (≈309.3 million triples via query; ≈94.4 million in metadata) with a working HTTPS SPARQL endpoint, clear licensing, and excellent FAIR scores for Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Availability is good overall, though RDF dump links are not retrievable via query and none were found, despite being indicated in metadata. Performance is moderate. Representational conciseness is mixed (reasonable URI lengths, heavy use of blank nodes). Understandability is modest (about 2.15% of triples carry labels). Interlinking to external datasets is extremely low (degree 1, near-zero centrality), though many sameAs chains and SKOS mappings are present internally. Consistency is mixed due to a detected ontology hijacking issue, while accuracy and conciseness are excellent. Currency is limited (creation date 2011 with no modification date), but timeliness is strong (reported monthly updates).

Overall Summary   LiLa Lemma Bank is a mid-sized dataset (about 1.70 million triples) that shows good Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability (FAIR) signals in the metadata: it declares a machine-readable CC BY-SA license, provides a working access point to a data dump (via GitHub), and includes contact/source information. It also reports interlinks to other datasets. However, the lack of a confirmed working SPARQL endpoint for this specific dataset prevents the assessment of many critical data-quality dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.), and several representational aspects are not documented. As a result, the normalized quality score remains low at 12.1 out of 100\. The availability and format of the RDF dump could also be improved (no commonly accepted RDF media type recorded in the metadata).  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Overall Summary   LiLa Lemma Bank is a medium-sized dataset (approximately 1.70 million triples) with moderate FAIR scores driven by good metadata, a machine-readable license (CC BY-SA), and publisher/source details. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint severely undermines core quality dimensions such as Performance, Security, Consistency, and Accuracy, and prevents verification of many data-intrinsic metrics.

Best value: 1.# LiLa Lemma Bank (2025-06-01)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the LiLa Lemma Bank knowledge graph (KG id: LemmaBank), based on the report from 2025-06-01. Overall Summary   LiLa Lemma Bank contains about 1,699,687 triples. It shows relatively strong FAIR results for Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability thanks to explicit metadata, a machine-readable CC BY-SA license, and publisher/source information. However, the absence of a working SPARQL endpoint severely hampers overall quality: many critical dimensions (Performance, Security, Consistency, Accuracy, etc.) cannot be measured and score zero. Interlinking indicators are present in metadata (degree 21), but with the endpoint unavailable, several interlinking checks remain unassessed and the interlinking score is 0.0. An RDF dump is indicated as available via GitHub, but no commonly accepted RDF media type is advertised.

Overall Summary   Allie provides a very large knowledge graph (≈303.1 million triples observed via query; ≈94.4 million declared in metadata) with an online SPARQL endpoint and strong FAIR scores. Accessibility, licensing, security, accuracy, and conciseness are strong. However, interlinking is extremely weak, consistency issues are flagged (including ontology hijacking), and representational versatility and understandability are low. Metadata lacks update/maintenance signals, giving poor timeliness. Despite the robust FAIR profile, the overall normalized quality score is low: 9.992 out of 100\. Improving interlinking, publishing working dump links, clarifying update cadence, and addressing consistency issues would markedly raise quality.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Allie contains abbreviations and their corresponding long forms extracted from titles and abstracts in the entire MEDLINE®, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine. MEDLINE stores over 20 million bibliographic information in life science and is suitable for extracting domain specific abbreviations and their long forms appearing in actual literature.     - Dataset URL: [http://allie.dbcls.jp/](http://allie.dbcls.jp/)     - Is on a trusted provider list: False     - Trust value: 0.75   - Reputation (Score: 8.993130969263282e-06/1)     - PageRank: 8.993130969263282e-05   - Verifiability (Score: 0.165/1)     - Author (query): \-     - Author (metadata): False     - Contributor: \-     - Publisher: \-     - Sources: Web:[http://allie.dbcls.jp/](http://allie.dbcls.jp/) Name:Database Center for Life Science Email:info AT dbcls.rois.ac.jp     - Signed: False  Intrinsic  - Consistency (Score: 0.4/1)     - Deprecated classes/properties used: 1.0     - Entities as member of disjoint class: \-     - Triples with misplaced property problem: 1.0     - Triples with misplaced class problem: 1.0     - Ontology Hijacking problem: True     - Undefined class used without declaration: 1.0     - Undefined properties used without declaration: 0.9999996338313242   - Conciseness (Score: 0.9911137222222222/1)     - Extensional conciseness: 0.987783 (out of 1,000,000 triples considered)     - Intensional conciseness: 0.9944444444444445 (out of 180 triples considered)   - Accuracy (Score: 0.9999996/1)     - Triples with empty annotation problem: 1.0     - Triples with white space in annotation(at the beginning or at the end): 0.999998     - Triples with malformed data type literals problem: 1.0     - Functional properties with inconsistent values: 1.0     - Invalid usage of inverse-functional properties: 1.0  FAIR (Score: 3.85)  - F (Score: 0.97/1)     - F1-M Unique and persistent ID: 1     - F1-D URIs dereferenceability: 0.815     - F2a-M \- Metadata availability via standard primary sources: 1     - F2b-M Metadata availability for all the attributes covered in the FAIR score computation: 1.0     - F3-M Data referrable via a DOI: 1     - F4-M Metadata registered in a searchable engine: 1   - A (Score: 1.0/1)     - A1-D Working access point(s): 1.0     - A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources: 1     - A1.2 Authentication & HTTPS support: 1.0     - A2-M Registered in search engines: 1   - I (Score: 0.88/1)     - I1-D Standard & open representation format: 1     - I1-M Metadata are described with VoID/DCAT predicates: 1     - I2 Use of FAIR vocabularies: 0.5     - I3-D Degree of connection: 1   - R (Score: 1.0/1)     - R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source: 1     - R1.2 Publisher information such as authors-contributors-publishers and sources: 1     - R1.3-D Data organized in a standardized way: 1     - R1.3-M Metadata are described with VoID/DCAT predicates: 1  Overall Scores  - Overall quality Score: 0.1   - Normalized quality Score: 9.992 out of 100  Identifiers  - KG id: allie-abbreviation-and-long-form-database-in-life-science   - KG name: Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science   - Analysis date: 2025-05-04  Notes and recommendations  - Publish stable, working RDF dump download links to align query and metadata availability.   - Improve interlinking to other datasets (increase degree and centrality) and provide explicit SKOS mappings where appropriate.   - Address consistency issues (ontology hijacking and schema misuse) and document vocabulary usage.   - Enhance metadata with modification dates and update frequency; expand language tags and serialization format declarations.   - Reduce reliance on blank nodes where possible and increase labeling coverage to improve understandability.# Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science (2025-06-01)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-06-01. Overall Summary Allie is a large, actively served biomedical KG with an operational SPARQL endpoint and roughly 303 million triples. It shows strong FAIR performance (F=0.98, A=1.0, I=0.88, R=1.0; FAIR total 3.86), excellent licensing, security (HTTPS), and very high intrinsic quality (near-perfect accuracy and strong conciseness). Notable weaknesses include extremely low interlinking to external datasets, moderate consistency risks (ontology hijacking flagged), relatively low understandability (only 2.15% of triples carry labels/comments), and heavy use of blank nodes. Despite metadata indicating monthly updates, no modification timestamp could be retrieved. The overall normalized quality score is 56.5 out of 100 (Score: 0.565).  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Overall Summary   The Coronavirus dataset is a large knowledge graph (\~81 million triples by query; \~71 million by metadata) with a working SPARQL endpoint and strong scores for Licensing, Accuracy, Conciseness, Interpretability, and FAIR principles (overall FAIR score: 3.19 out of 4). The endpoint performs moderately (median latency \~0.533 s; throughput \~2 req/s) and URIs are largely dereferenceable (0.9686). However, the absence of an RDF dump and of declared serialization formats or media types, no HTTPS, very limited interlinking, low understandability (only 9.1% of triples have labels), and missing update/currency information lower overall quality. The normalized overall quality score is 46.1 out of 100\.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Publish an RDF dump with a common RDF media type (e.g., application/ld+json, text/turtle) and advertise serialization formats to boost Versatility and FAIR I1-D/R1.3-D.   - Enable HTTPS on the SPARQL endpoint to improve Security (and align A1.2).   - Increase interlinking to external datasets (sameAs and SKOS mappings) to improve Interlinking, Completeness, and FAIR I3-D.   - Improve documentation and understandability: add labels/comments for more entities, provide vocabularies used, and examples of SPARQL queries.   - Provide currency metadata (creation/modification dates, update frequency) to improve Dynamicity.  ---# Coronavirus dataset (2025-05-04)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the Coronavirus dataset (KG id: micro-coronavirus), based on the report from 2025-05-04. Overall Summary The Coronavirus dataset is a large knowledge graph with approximately 80.9 million triples (70.9M stated in metadata). It offers a working SPARQL endpoint and strong licensing metadata, and achieves high scores in accuracy, intrinsic conciseness, interpretability (few modeling anti-patterns), and FAIR (overall 3.19/4). However, the absence of an RDF dump and low HTTPS/security features limit accessibility. Interlinking and metadata versatility are weak (few declared vocabularies, no alternate serializations, no update frequency), and there are notable consistency issues (including ontology hijacking flags). Overall normalized quality score: 46.06 out of 100 (score: 0.461).  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Overall Summary The Coronavirus dataset provides a working SPARQL endpoint with very high URI dereferenceability, complete licensing information, and strong intrinsic data quality (perfect Accuracy and near-perfect Conciseness). FAIR scores are overall strong (F=0.94, A=1.0, I=0.5, R=0.75; total 3.19). Performance is moderate and the graph is sizable (≈80.9M triples reported by query). However, there is no downloadable RDF dump advertised or found, HTTPS is not supported, Understandability is very low (few labels relative to triples), Interlinking quality is effectively negligible, and dataset dynamicity (currency/timeliness) is not documented. Ontology hijacking is flagged. The normalized overall quality score is 46.06 out of 100\.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Keep the SPARQL endpoint online; it is a major strength. Improve performance if feasible.   - Publish and advertise an RDF dump in a standard RDF serialization with a commonly accepted media type; this will improve Availability, Versatility, and Reusability.   - Enable HTTPS on the endpoint for better Security and FAIR A1.2 alignment.   - Improve Understandability by increasing rdfs:label/rdfs:comment coverage and documenting vocabularies used; add SPARQL example queries.   - Address the Ontology hijacking flag and validate schema usage to further raise the Consistency score.   - Document update policies and last-modified dates to improve Currency/Timeliness.   - Strengthen interlinking quality (e.g., add SKOS mapping properties, improve external links) to move the Interlinking score beyond near-zero.  ---# Coronavirus dataset (2025-09-07)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the Coronavirus dataset knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-09-07.   Overall Summary   The Coronavirus dataset is a large-scale knowledge graph (approximately 81 million triples as queried; \~71 million by metadata) with a working SPARQL endpoint and high URI dereferenceability. It achieves strong marks for Licensing (machine- and human-readable licenses present), Accuracy, and Conciseness, and shows very good FAIR sub-scores for Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability (FAIR sum: 3.0/4). However, the dataset lacks an RDF dump and any declared serialization formats, which harms Versatility and limits offline re-use. Interlinking is present but extremely weak overall despite many sameAs chains, and Representational Understandability is low (labels cover about 9.1% of triples and no vocabularies are exposed). Security is only partial (no HTTPS), dataset dynamicity cannot be assessed (no modification or update info), and an ontology hijacking issue is detected. The resulting normalized quality score is 46.1 out of 100\.   Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Best value: 1.  ---# Coronavirus dataset (2025-08-03)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the Coronavirus dataset knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-08-03.   Overall Summary   The micro-coronavirus knowledge graph provides a working SPARQL endpoint and a sizable corpus of roughly 81 million triples (≈71 million per metadata; ≈81 million via query). It performs well on several intrinsic dimensions (Accuracy and Conciseness are very high), has strong FAIR sub-scores overall (F=0.75, A=1.0, I=0.5, R=0.75; aggregate FAIR=3.0/4), and offers machine-readable licensing from both metadata and queries. However, the dataset lacks an accessible RDF dump and declared serialization/media types, has no declared update frequency or modification dates, uses no HTTPS, and shows very low interlinking and understandability (few labels relative to graph size, no declared vocabularies). Consistency shows mixed results due to detected ontology hijacking despite otherwise strong per-metric values. The normalized overall quality score is 46.052 out of 100 (raw 0.461).

Strengths: Working SPARQL endpoint; high dereferenceability; clear licensing; very strong Accuracy and Conciseness; solid FAIR A/F/R sub-scores.   - Weaknesses: No RDF dump or declared media types; no HTTPS or authentication; very low interlinking and understandability; dynamicity metadata absent; consistency flagged by ontology hijacking.   - Improvements to prioritize:     - Publish an RDF dump with standard media types (e.g., application/n-triples, application/ld+json) and advertise it in VoID/DCAT.     - Enable HTTPS and document security/authentication policy.     - Increase labels/comments coverage and disclose vocabularies used.     - Provide update frequency and last-modified dates.     - Strengthen interlinking and SKOS mappings to external KGs.  ---  ## dblp (2025-09-07)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the dblp Knowledge Graph (KG id: dblp-kg), based on the report from 2025-09-07.   Overall Summary   The dblp Knowledge Graph is a very large and actively curated dataset, with about 1.45 billion triples accessible via a working SPARQL endpoint. It scores highly on Findability, Accessibility, and Reusability (FAIR), provides clear machine‑readable CC0 licensing, and shows excellent performance. Accuracy and conciseness are strong. However, overall quality is limited by weak interlinking (per metadata), low dynamicity evidence (missing modification and update frequency signals), limited understandability (few labels relative to total triples and no vocabulary list), and consistency risks (ontology hijacking flagged). HTTPS support was not detected by the metric, and no authentication is required. The normalized quality score is 42.0 out of 100\.

Overall Summary   The dblp Knowledge Graph is a very large and operational dataset (\~1.45 billion triples via SPARQL) with a working SPARQL endpoint and good performance. It provides machine-readable CC0 licensing and multiple download links, and achieves strong FAIR scores (overall FAIR score: 3.46). Strengths include Availability, Performance, Accuracy, Conciseness, and Interoperability. However, several aspects limit the overall normalized quality score (43.2 out of 100): dynamicity is not machine-verified (no currency/timeliness evidence), interlinking metrics are largely unavailable or extremely low despite many sameAs chains, security is only partial, and understandability remains low despite a large number of labels. There are also notable consistency warnings (ontology hijacking detected, and signals of misplacement/undefined term usage), although accuracy-oriented checks score maximally.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Consider ensuring the endpoint or metadata explicitly reflects HTTPS usage to align the security metric, or adjust the metric computation if already using HTTPS.   - Dynamicity signals in prose (daily sync) are not machine-verified; expose modification timestamps, creation age, and update frequency in VoID/DCAT to raise Currency/Timeliness.   - Interlinking metrics are largely missing or near-zero despite many sameAs chains. Publish explicit inter-dataset links and SKOS mapping properties, and ensure their discoverability to raise the Interlinking score (and FAIR I3-D).   - Understandability is low despite many labels; improve coverage of rdfs:label/comment, provide examples, and document vocabularies used.   - Consistency warnings (ontology hijacking detected; signals of misplacement/undefined terms) should be investigated; publishing and validating the schema, and ensuring proper term declarations, will improve Consistency.   - Maintain strong Accuracy and Conciseness practices; these are standout strengths for dblp KG.  ---  ## dblp (2025-07-13)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the dblp Knowledge Graph, based on the report from 2025-07-13. Overall Summary   The dblp Knowledge Graph is a very large dataset (about 1.45 billion triples) with a working SPARQL endpoint and downloadable RDF dumps. It achieves excellent Availability and Performance, provides machine-readable CC0 licensing, and scores very high on Intrinsic Accuracy and Conciseness. FAIR compliance is strong overall (FAIR score 3.46/4), with perfect scores for Accessibility and Reusability sub-principles. However, security is only moderate (no HTTPS confirmed in the Accessibility/Security metrics), Understandability is low despite many labels, dynamicity information is missing (no creation/modification dates or update frequency), and interlinking metrics are largely absent (very low Interlinking score) even though many owl:sameAs chains exist.

Overall Summary   NoiPA is a very large knowledge graph (\~440 million triples by query) with a working SPARQL endpoint and excellent performance. FAIR scores are solid overall (2.57/4), with strong Accessibility (A=1.0) and Reusability (R=0.75). Interoperability is moderate (I=0.25) due to missing standard/open media types and absent interlinking. Availability is mixed: while the SPARQL endpoint is online and many distribution URLs are listed, automated checks flag the RDF dump as missing/offline, and no common media type is confirmed. Trust is acceptable (Believability 0.75; Verifiability \~0.50) though external Reputation is very low. Intrinsic data quality is strong on Accuracy and Conciseness but weakened by Consistency issues (e.g., ontology hijacking detected).

Overall Summary   NoiPA is a very large public-sector knowledge graph with roughly 446 million triples (query-based count) and an online SPARQL endpoint. It features strong performance, solid provenance and licensing signals, and extensive publisher information. However, Findability and Interoperability are constrained by non-dereferenceable URIs and limited interlinking to external datasets. Metadata and dumps are inconsistently exposed: although many dataset download links exist (CSV and RDF), RDF dump availability is reported as missing/offline in both metadata- and query-based checks. Representational versatility and understandability are weak (few formats declared, no common media type confirmed, low share of labeled triples). Overall, the dataset achieves a normalized quality score of 52.47 out of 100\.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Overall Summary   NoiPA is a very large knowledge graph (≈412.9 million triples by query; 340 million by metadata) with a working SPARQL endpoint. It shows strong performance (fast latency, good throughput), robust Intrinsic quality (high Accuracy and Conciseness), and good Trust/FAIR metadata (machine-readable licenses, publisher info, VoID/DCAT usage). However, dereferenceability is 0, inter-dataset linking is effectively absent (degree 0), and representational versatility is weak (no languages or serializations advertised in metadata, no accepted media type detected by the checker). RDF dumps are not detected as available via metadata, and the dump status via query is flagged as offline, despite many distribution URLs being listed. Overall normalized quality score: 52.477 out of 100 (overall score 0.525).  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Best value: 1.# NoiPA (2025-06-01)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the NoiPA knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-06-01. Overall Summary NoiPA is a very large public-sector knowledge graph (about 419 million triples by query, 340 million by metadata) with a working SPARQL endpoint and excellent measured performance. It provides machine-readable licensing and clear publisher information, and it reports update frequency (annual). However, it shows weak interlinking to external datasets (degree 0, centrality 0\) and URIs are not dereferenceable (0.0). Representational versatility is poor (no declared serialization formats or media types in metadata, and dumps reported as missing/offline by the metrics despite many dataset landing pages), and HTTPS is reported as not used by the endpoint (security score \= 0.5). Intrinsic accuracy and conciseness are very high, but consistency is moderate due to ontology-hijacking warnings and undefined terms flags. Understandability is low, with labels on only 8.06% of triples. Overall, the normalized quality score is 52.48 out of 100\.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Best value: 1.# NoiPA (2025-07-13)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the NoiPA knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-07-13. Overall Summary NoiPA provides a working SPARQL endpoint and a very large graph (≈433M triples by query; 340M by metadata). Accessibility and Performance are decent overall, and Reusability (license, publisher) is clearly stated. However, Interlinking to external datasets is essentially absent (degree 0), URIs are not dereferenceable (0.0), and Security is only partial (no HTTPS detected by the checks, no authentication). Representational versatility is weak: no languages or serialization formats advertised in metadata, and the dump availability checks report “missing/offline” despite many advertised download URLs. Understandability is low (labels on 8.09% of triples), while Intrinsic Accuracy and Conciseness are very high. Consistency is mixed and flags an ontology hijacking issue, leading to a moderate consistency score.

Overall Summary CIDOC-CRM presents itself as an ontology for cultural heritage integration, but as a dataset it lacks a working SPARQL endpoint and exposes no measurable data via queries. While metadata claims an RDF dump is available and downloadable, no actual download URLs are provided and no RDF media type is advertised (only text/html). Licensing is not indicated. Interlinking signals are absent. A few trust-related signals are present (clear description and a dataset URL), yielding modest believability and verifiability scores. The overall normalized quality score is 9.6 out of 100 (raw score 0.096). The FAIR composite score is 2.03, driven by Findability and some Accessibility/Reusability metadata, but hampered by missing dereferenceable URIs, licensing, and interlinking.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

It can help researchers, administrators and the public explore complex questions with regards to our past across diverse and dispersed datasets. The CIDOC CRM achieves this by providing definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation and of general interest for the querying and exploration of such data. Such models are also known as formal ontologies. These formal descriptions allow the integration of data from multiple sources in a software and schema agnostic fashion.     - Dataset URL: [https://cidoc-crm.org/](https://cidoc-crm.org/)     - Is on a trusted provider list: False     - Trust value: 0.75   - Reputation (Score: 0.0/1)          - PageRank: \- (Not available.)   - Verifiability (Score: 0.332/1)          - Author (query): \-     - Author (metadata): Name: absent, email: absent     - Contributor: \-     - Publisher: \-     - Sources: Web:[https://cidoc-crm.org/](https://cidoc-crm.org/) Name:  Email:     - Signed: \-  Intrinsic  - Consistency (Score: 0.0/1)          - Deprecated classes/properties used: \-     - Entities as member of disjoint class: \-     - Triples with misplaced property problem: \-     - Triples with misplaced class problem: \-     - Ontology Hijacking problem: \-     - Undefined class used without declaration: \-     - Undefined properties used without declaration: \-   - Conciseness (Score: 0.0/1)          - Extensional conciseness: \-     - Intensional conciseness: \-   - Accuracy (Score: 0.0/1)          - Triples with empty annotation problem: \-     - Triples with white space in annotation(at the beginning or at the end): \-     - Triples with malformed data type literals problem: \-     - Functional properties with inconsistent values: \-     - Invalid usage of inverse-functional properties: \-  FAIR (Score: 2.03)  - F (Score: 0.78/1)          - F1-M Unique and persistent ID: 1     - F1-D URIs dereferenceability: 0.0     - F2a-M \- Metadata availability via standard primary sources: 1     - F2b-M Metadata availability for all the attributes covered in the FAIR score computation: 0.67     - F3-M Data referrable via a DOI: 1     - F4-M Metadata registered in a searchable engine: 1   - A (Score: 0.5/1)          - A1-D Working access point(s): 1.0     - A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources: 0     - A1.2 Authentication & HTTPS support: 0.0     - A2-M Registered in search engines: 1   - I (Score: 0.25/1)          - I1-D Standard & open representation format: 0     - I1-M Metadata are described with VoID/DCAT predicates: 1     - I2 Use of FAIR vocabularies: 0.0     - I3-D Degree of connection: 0   - R (Score: 0.5/1)          - R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source: 0     - R1.2 Publisher information such as authors-contributors-publishers and sources: 1     - R1.3-D Data organized in a standardized way: 0     - R1.3-M Metadata are described with VoID/DCAT predicates: 1  Overall Scores  - Overall quality score: 0.096   - Normalized quality score: 9.575 (≈9.6 out of 100\)# dblp (2025-05-04)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the dblp Knowledge Graph (KG id: dblp-kg), based on the report from 2025-05-04.   Overall Summary   The dblp Knowledge Graph is a very large, actively synchronized scholarly dataset with an operational SPARQL endpoint and excellent performance. It provides machine-readable CC0 licensing and clear source and contact information, yielding very strong FAIR scores (3.45/4). Strengths include high dereferenceability (0.9), extremely large scale (≈1.335B triples via query), and near-perfect intrinsic accuracy and conciseness. However, overall quality is moderated by very weak interlinking to external datasets, limited representational understandability (few labels relative to total triples, no vocabularies list), incomplete metadata for dynamicity (no last-modified or update frequency reported), and mixed signals on security (HTTPS not detected by metric; no authentication). The normalized overall quality score is 43.2 out of 100\.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Strengths include Accuracy (1.0), Conciseness (0.994), Interoperability (0.671), and Performance (1.0). Areas needing improvement are URI dereferenceability (0.0), interlinking (near-zero), understandability (0.027), and documented update/currency signals. Security is mixed (HTTPS reported as False by the checker, no auth). The normalized overall quality score is 40.7 out of 100\.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown   Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

Best value: 1.  ---# CIDOC-CRM (2025-07-13)  This is a detailed quality analysis for the CIDOC-CRM knowledge graph, based on the report from 2025-07-13. Overall Summary CIDOC-CRM is a widely used conceptual model in cultural heritage. In this assessment, however, it behaves more like a website/ontology page than an operational knowledge graph service. There is no SPARQL endpoint, no exposed download URL for an RDF dump, and no machine- or human-readable license detected. Interlinking and most data-driven checks cannot be performed. Despite that, the dataset scores relatively well on believability and some FAIR F- and A-subprinciples due to metadata presence and discoverability. Overall quality is low, with a normalized score of 9.6 out of 100\.  ---  Detailed Quality Breakdown Below is a metric-by-metric analysis, grouped by quality category and dimension.

It can help researchers, administrators and the public explore complex questions with regards to our past across diverse and dispersed datasets. The CIDOC CRM achieves this by providing definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation and of general interest for the querying and exploration of such data. Such models are also known as formal ontologies. These formal descriptions allow the integration of data from multiple sources in a software and schema agnostic fashion.     - Dataset URL: [https://cidoc-crm.org/](https://cidoc-crm.org/)     - Is on a trusted provider list: False     - Trust value: 0.75   - Reputation (Score: 0.0/1)          - PageRank: \- (Not available; not interlinked.)   - Verifiability (Score: 0.332/1)          - Author (query): \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Author (metadata): Name: absent, email: absent     - Contributor: \-     - Publisher: \-     - Sources: Web:[https://cidoc-crm.org/](https://cidoc-crm.org/) Name:  Email:     - Signed: \-  Intrinsic  - Consistency (Score: 0.0/1)          - Deprecated classes/properties used: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Entities as member of disjoint class: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Triples with misplaced property problem: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Triples with misplaced class problem: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Ontology Hijacking problem: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Undefined class used without declaration: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Undefined properties used without declaration: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)   - Conciseness (Score: 0.0/1)          - Extensional conciseness: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Intensional conciseness: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)   - Accuracy (Score: 0.0/1)          - Triples with empty annotation problem: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Triples with white space in annotation (at the beginning or at the end): \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Triples with malformed data type literals problem: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Functional properties with inconsistent values: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)     - Invalid usage of inverse-functional properties: \- (SPARQL endpoint is missing.)
